# hubdb-cards
## Inspiration
Thanks to the wonderful design by the designer on this project and quick movement from implementing a Hubspot theme, our main goal was to build a tool for the hospital's website that would be easy for users to find the right doctor for their needs, whether it was based on specialty, name, location, or some other factors. 

## What it does
The tool will generate cards that showcase information found on HubDB rows uploaded by the client. It will render these cards all at once for the full database, then only show certain cards based on various filters that the user can narrow focus on.

There are other features of this tool that are interesting, including the dynamic link generating for Google Maps based on entry data for the doctor, how filters are combined, and the overall frontend styling is responsive.

## How we built it
The first step was in the design. After design approval, the build was relatively straightforward, using the provided Hubspot documentation for HubDB rendering via Hubl and a custom module. Some tweaking occurred throughout the project to better align with how the data was being entered and the functionality of Hubspot. The tool is undergoing continuous improvement with added features based on user behavior. 

## Challenges we ran into
The most challenging part of the project was in how the data could be used to generate different front-end outcomes. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The tool functions as expected, so now the client is simply in optimization mode, with the current build as functional and safe without any further improvements. 

## What we learned
Not all builds are the same, but the community posts in Hubspot include a depth of discussion and information that is incredibly helpful in supplementing the documentation provided. 

## What's next for Find a Doctor
More targeted filtering, a better render of results based on client priorities mixed with user search, clearing of query parameters to reset a search after results, and other components of cards may be added in the future based on clients needs. Also, dynamic pages to be created and showcased in the future once more content is added in HubDB.
